    <h2>Hello.</h2>
    <p class="bio">After having been an English teacher for over 7 years, I'm convinced that maintaining structure and being organised make for success in and outside of the classroom. Compassion and empathy are two skills that I deem necessary during all communications. Advising and coaching people on making the best choices in numerous contexts is what I excel at. Plus: I can always make my colleagues smile with my baking and my laughter and humour. Skills: coaching, advising, effective communication, sales, writing, project planning and coordinating, team leadership, people development, language teaching, translation, curriculum development, baking.</p>
